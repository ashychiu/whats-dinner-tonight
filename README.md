# whats-dinner-tonight

#### Description

The purpose of this project is to participate a mini-hackathon to showcase what I have learned so far 5 weeks into Brainstation's Web Development Bootcamp.
Including HTML by using BEM, CSS by using SASS & flex box, JavaScript DOM manipulation, addEventListener and API request by using axios.

#### Background

Ever since the pandemic, more and more people stay home and cook at home. But the pandemic has been going on for 2 years now, a lot of us run out of idea what to cook for dinner especially if they are working and have to cook for their families. This application provides recipe suggestions based on what ingredients are available.
