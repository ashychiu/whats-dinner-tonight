# whats-dinner-tonight

#### Description

The purpose of this project is to participate a mini-hackathon in Nov 2021 to showcase what I have learned so far 5 weeks into Brainstation's Web Development Bootcamp -
including HTML by using BEM with responsive design, CSS by using SASS & flex box, JavaScript DOM manipulation, addEventListener & higer order function, and API request by using axios.

#### Background

Ever since the pandemic, more and more people stay home and cook. A lot of us run out of idea of "what is for dinner tonight" especially those who are working or have to cook for their families. Sometimes food goes bad before we figure what to do with them. This application provides recipe suggestions based on what ingredients are available.
